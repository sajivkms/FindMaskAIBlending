 USING other files and ERROR Conditions.
 -------------------------------------------
 Using your own files can be done ,however following points needs to be kept in mind.
 1) The Model is only trained to identify certain objects.
 Here is the list
 Aeroplane	Bicycle		Bird	Boat		Bottle	Bus		Car
 Cat		Chair		Cow		DiningTable	Dog		Horse	Motorbike
 Person		Pottedplant	Sheep	Sofa		Train	TVMonitor	
 2) Make sure that the images are in smaller resolution. I havent trapped errors , you would just see a blank screen
 3) Choose the Blending Region correctly as it can run out of index and show again a blank screen.
